## M5PaperWeather
My takes on that great project thanks to the original forks of forks, see above.
- The libraries have been upgraded.
- Added experimental support for **M5Paper S3** using `M5Unified` and `M5GFX`.
- I’ve added two view and kept the two forked views and it’s simple two swap between them. Simply uncomment/comment the declaration inside the lines 28 to 31 in main.cpp
- pio run -t upload
